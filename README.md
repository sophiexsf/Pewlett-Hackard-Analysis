## Overview

Managers at Pewlett Hackard are concerned about the aging workforce and want to understand how many employees are expected to retire over time. Additionally, they wish to identify younger employees who can partake in a mentorship program to retain the knowledge which would otherwise be lost as those employees retire.

## Results

A large number of employees will become eligible for retirement over the next few years. Our analysis shows the following:

* Current employees born between 1952 and 1955, i.e. who are 67-70 years old this year, number 72,458.
* 25,916 Senior Engineers and 24,926 Senior Staff will be eligible for retirement.
* Only 2 employees with the title Manager will be eligible for retirement.
* 1,549 current employees are good candidates for the mentorship program based on their age.

## Summary

If all retiring employees' roles were to be replaced, Pewlett Hackard will need to hire roughly 70,000 new employees to handle the effects of the "silver tsunami".

Listing all employees born in 1965, there are 1,549 candidates to mentor the younger generation. Even if all candidates participate in the program that would mean each one would be responsible for training 45 people, suggesting that a wider pool of mentors needs to be identified.

For a better idea of when people will actually retire, further analysis could be done on the dept_emp table to find out the average tenure of employees by department, or on the titles table to find out tenure by job title. If any department or title shows a trend toward employees retiring early or late it might help predict the future pattern of retirements.
